Steganography is the practice of concealing a secret message within another, ordinary, message.The messages can be images, text, video, audio etc. In modern steganography, the goal is to covertly communicate a digital message. The main aim of steganogrpahy is to prevent the detection of a hidden message. It is often combined with cryptography to improve the security of the hidden message.Steganalysis is the study of detecting messages hidden using steganography (breaking); this is analogous to cryptanalysis applied to cryptography.Steganography is used in applications like confidential communication, secret data storing, digital watermarking etcteganography is the practice of concealing a secret message within another, ordinary, message.The messages can be images, text, video, audio etc. In modern steganography, the goal is to covertly communicate a digital message.
